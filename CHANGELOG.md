# Changes in PHPUnuhi

All notable changes of SVRUnit releases are documented in this file
using the [Keep a CHANGELOG](https://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## [unreleased]

### Added

- Add new **list:translations** command to see all IDs of Translation-Sets
- Add new **Filters** with allow and exclude lists. This also supports wildards with '*'
- Add new **groups** of translations. This is required for a 3rd dimension. E.g. translations of products where every product has multiple rows with properties and different languages (columns).
- Add option to inject **PHP** server variables that can be used in different areas.
- Add Dbal/Connection to be used in MySQL driven storage formats.
- Add new Shopware 6 Storage format with full support of entities.
